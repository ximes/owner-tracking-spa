## What's this?
Aprilia Caponord owners are a fun bunch of people very happy with their motorcycles, from all over the world.
This **Aprilia Caponord Registry** is mainly meant as a quick programming exercise. 
It doesn't claim to be anything but an unofficial, voluntary registry of ownership, which would make easy to tell how many of us there are and where we are located, how old are our bike and how long we traveled.
I'm not associated with Aprilia or any local group.

# Privacy & Data

Data is stored in a Google Firestore's database. 

The following data is stored upon registration:
- color, year, and model of your Caponord
- overall mileage (it just gives a rough idea of bike's longevity)
- estimated location

Location selected is always approximated to city/town level, as it's intended to give an overall idea of how Caponord are distributed. 
It doesn't give up the position where the bike is stored, nor it tracks the position of the device you're using. What you select as location is totally up to you!

None of the collected information is identified as personal data so there's nothing you should worry about. Collected data is stored for statistical/visualisation purposes only.
